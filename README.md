# This is a repo for my projects in web development

# Project 1: a Login routine
##	- using PHP and SQLite3, the scripts (login21.php, register.php and logout.php lay out the fundamental steps in adding a login functionality to a website (accessing the index php. 
##	- forms were designed using Bootstrap


# Project 2: playing media and uploading files
##	- here the idea was to build media (audio) player pages with increasing sophistication:
##		- player1.html plays a single song. 
##		- player2.html plays multiple files. 
##		- player3.php plays multiple files whose names are in an array. Generates the html audio tags within a loop reading the array contents.
##		- player4.php reads a text file (playlist) and populates an array then generates the html audio tags within a loop reading the array contents.
##		- player5.php reads a CSV file that contains multiple columns with additional information to the name of the song. It reads the file into an array of arrays while splitting the data to be later assigned to variables and rendered in the html playlist. 

##	- uploading files:
##		- uploadForm.html and upload.php: upload images to the target directory.
##		- uploadMP3Form.html and uploadMP3.php do the same for audio files. 

##		All html files used Bootstrap.
